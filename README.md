# PostPin
PostPin is an artistic social media app for creative and expressive outlet. Concept is based on post secret. Post secret was a media campaign that request people to send their secret on a postcard. Our social media app will allow users to express themselves thru their own profile or they can post it anonymously. We will also provide engagement metrics for user to better understand their posts to better their art. 

## Starting the app locally

Start by installing front and backend dependencies. While in this directory, run the following commands:

```
npm install
cd client
npm install
cd ..
``

After both installations complete, run the following command in your terminal:

```
npm start
```

That's it, your app should be running on <http://localhost:3000>. The Express server should intercept any AJAX requests from the client.

## Deployment (Heroku)

After confirming that you have an up to date git repository and a Heroku app created, complete the following:

1. Build the React app for production by running the following command:

```
npm build
```

2. Add and commit all changes to git

3. Push to Heroku

If all previous steps were followed correctly, your application should be deployed to Heroku!
